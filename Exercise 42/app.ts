// Exercise 42

// Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 39. Write a function called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians by adding the 
// phrase the Great to each magicianâ€™s name. Call show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified.

// Define the function to shown magicians names

function show_magicians(magicians: string[]){
    magicians.forEach(name => console.log(name));
}

// Function to make magicians great through .map() it will modify array
function make_great(magicians: string[]){
    return magicians.map(name => `The Great ${name}`);
}

// Define an array of magicians names
let magicians_names = ["Atif Aslam", "Mehdi Hassan", "Farman", "Sameer"];

// Call make_great function to modify magicians names
let great_magicians = make_great(magicians_names)

// Call show _magicians that show modified list of magicians
show_magicians(great_magicians)
